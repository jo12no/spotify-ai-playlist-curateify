# Spotify AI Playlist: Curateify ðŸŽ§ðŸ¤–

TL:DR - End to end automated to Spotify, prompt a LLM for a custom playlist (eg. `"for fans of tame impala on a rainy morning:`) from your terminal. Alternatively, can use a `.txt` file with format `artist - track` and automatically make a playlist. 

An experimental CLI application designed to automate the curation of Spotify playlists via inference with multiple AI models. It supports multiple data sources including:
1) GPT & Gemini model outputs
2) Spotify API (`get-recommendations` endpoint).
3) Local .txt file (list of tracks or artist names exported from any service). 

## Features

- **Personalised Suggestions**: tuned towards "less mainstream" and "less popular" choices to enhance the discoverability of lesser-known artists who are typically overlooked by standard recommendations on the platform, but still receptive to user prompts. 
- **Playlist Management**: Create new playlists or update existing ones using Spotify's API.
- **User Interactions**: Simple prompts guide users through track selection and playlist configuration.
- **Advanced Processing**: Choose to process tracks individually or by artist for tailored playlist curation.


## Usage

To run the application, simply run it from your command line:

`python main.py`

You can customize `config.py` for settings.
