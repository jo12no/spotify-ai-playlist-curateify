# Spotify AI Playlist: Curateify ðŸŽ§ðŸ¤–

An experimental application designed to automate the curation of Spotify playlists via inference with multiple AI models. It supports multiple data sources including:
1) GPT & Gemini model outputs
2) Spotify API (`get-recommendations` endpoint).
3) Local .txt file (list of tracks or tracks exported from any service). 

## Features

- **Personalised Suggestions**: tuned towards "less mainstream" and "less popular" choices to enhance the discoverability of lesser-known artists who are typically overlooked by standard recommendations on the platform, but still receptive to user prompts. 
- **Playlist Management**: Create new playlists or update existing ones using Spotify's API.
- **User Interactions**: Simple prompts guide users through track selection and playlist configuration.
- **Session prompt to tune the AI**: .
- **Advanced Processing**: Choose to process tracks individually or by artist for tailored playlist curation.

`python main.py`
